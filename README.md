The following is a simple web application project, Delicious Restaurant, where I wanted to put into practice the knowledge acquired in a 
course I was doing, familiarize myself with the basics of web design and its operation in the code. 

For the same I used Video Studio Code as IDE

the tecnologies I use was:
HTML5
CSS

My intention was to create a kind of restaurant website, with a small list of typical dishes that I have been tasting during my stay here. It includes features such as displaying the menu, providing information about the restaurant's history, and allowing users to contact the restaurant via a form. also insert some youtube videos of the dishes.

Usage:

Once the repository is cloned and navigated to the project directory, simply open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.
