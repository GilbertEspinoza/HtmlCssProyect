The following is a very simple HTML and CSS project where I wanted to put into practice the knowledge acquired in a 
course I was doing, familiarize myself with the basics of web design and its operation in the code. 

My intention was to create a kind of restaurant website, with some of the dishes that I have been tasting during my stay here.

In the html part, we can see a header with a navigation menu; the home section redirects to the main part of the site, the menu section includes a small list of typical dishes,
has a contact section where you can fill out a contact form, also insert some youtube videos.

The design is quite simple, with some changes in color and font type and a colored background in the header.
